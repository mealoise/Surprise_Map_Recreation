The map shows sales rates of counties in the US.

The legend to the right of the maps shows the range each county falls within, given the color encoding.
**Clicking the legend color codings will show you a cluster of counties that belong to a particular range.**

If you hover over the map, a tooltip will pop-up. The tooltip also shows the sales rate and surprise value for each county.
          
The Surprise value is a measure of our change in belief given what we already know about the data.

We will ask you to use this map to give feedback on the task, based on where we can focus our marketing efforts in order to improve sales.
