## Title of Research Study: Supporting Data Visualization Literacy
## Introduction
You are being asked to participate in a research study. Before you
              agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of
              the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks
              or discomfort that you may experience as a result of your
              participation. This form presents information about the study so
              that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your
              participation.

## Purpose of the Study
We intend to evaluate how well people interpret a regularized map. Our study evaluates a
						Bayesian Weighting technique that allows us to show regions of interest on a map.

## Tasks
The experiment consists of two tasks. Each task is associated with a map, and you will be
						required
						to respond to a task, based on the requirements. The estimated time for the experiment is 7 minutes.

## Risks to study participants
Each participant in this study is assigned a random ID for analyses. As such,
your participation will remain anonymous and your responses will
not be used to identify you.

## Benefits to research participants and others:
You will learn about an interesting technique used to overcome the biases associated with
						Choropleth Maps.

## Record keeping and confidentiality
Records of your participation in this study will be held
confidential so far as permitted by law. However, the study
investigators, the sponsor or its designee and, under certain
circumstances, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute Institutional
Review Board (WPI IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to
this data. Any publication or presentation of the data will not
identify you.
