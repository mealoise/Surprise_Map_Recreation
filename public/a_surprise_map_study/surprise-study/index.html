            <b>Goal: </b> We intend to evaluate how well people interpret a regularized map. Our study evaluates a
            Bayesian Weighting technique that allows us to show regions of interest on a map.<br /><br />

            <b>Procedure:</b> The experiment consists of two tasks. Each task is associated with a map, and you will be
            required
            to respond to a task, based on the requirements. <br /><br />

            <b>Benefit: </b> You will learn about an interesting technique used to overcome the biases associated with
            Choropleth Maps.<br /><br />

            <b>Duration: </b> The estimated time for the experiment is 7 minutes. <br /><br />

            <b>Privacy: </b> Your participation is anonymous and your responses cannot be used to identify you.
            <br /><br />

            <b>Record Keeping: </b> Records of your participation will be held confidential so far as permitted by law.
            However, the study investigators and, under certain circumstances, the Institutional Review Board will be
            able to inspect and have access to this data. Any publication or presentation of the data will not identify
            you. <br /><br />

            <b>Reward: </b> $1.40. <br /><br />
